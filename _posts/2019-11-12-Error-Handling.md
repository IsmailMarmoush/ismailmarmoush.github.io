Have you wondered how to safely propagate errors and exceptions including the ones that are unknown (aka being Reactively **Resilient** )  from the very bottom layer of Repositories and DAOs up to the API ?

I wanted to address an issue that has always bugged me out, and I'm sure many when encountering such paradigm shift. With trial and error I have reached a seemingly satisfying state.

Requirements:
Basic knowledge of VAVR, Reactor, Reactor Netty.


## Basic wrapping of throws

Java is crazy with throwing Throwables right ? VAVR has cool feature from Scala (Try) which is basically an Either<Throwable, T>.

For any function **op** that throws an error you would basically wrap it into `Try.of(()-> op())` and I'll tell you why you'd need that later.

## Repo/DAO Layer
```java
public interface UserRepo{
	Mono<Try<UserEntity>> create(User user);
}

public class CreationError extends Throwable{}
public class AlreadyExists extends CreationError{}

public interface TwitterRepo{
	Mono<Try<Tweet>> get(String id);
}
public class ServiceUnavailable extends Throwable{}

```
## Service Layer
```java
public interface UserService{
	Mono<Try<UserRespDto>>create(UserReqDto udto);
	Mono<Void> deleteResource(ResourceReqDto rdto);
}
```
## Utilities Layer
```java
public static NettyOutbound send(HttpServerResponse resp, int status, String s, HttpHeaders headers) {  
  return resp.status(status).headers(headers).sendString(Mono.just(s));  
}  
  
public static NettyOutbound sendError(HttpServerResponse resp, NettyHttpError nhe) {  
  HttpHeaders header = nhe.httpHeaders.isDefined() ? nhe.httpHeaders.get() : EmptyHttpHeaders.INSTANCE;  
  return resp.status(nhe.statusCode)  
             .headers(resp.responseHeaders().add(header))  
             .sendString(Mono.just(nhe.message.getOrElse("Error")));  
}
...
/* In the `adapt` method you would map all possible 
errors to their preferred answers, plus the last one which maps any other to a 500

And of course you would definitely add normal Java exception classes if needed.
*/
public NettyHttpError adapt(Throwable t) {  
  return Match(t).of(Case($(instanceOf(ServiceUnavailable.class)), () -> new NettyHttpError(401, t)),  
                     Case($(instanceOf(AlreadyExists.class)), () -> new NettyHttpError(400, t)),  
                     Case($(), () -> new NettyHttpError(500, t)));  
}
```
## API Layer
```java
public class UserController{
	// nhea.adapt(..) would return a NettyHttpError that maps t:Throwable to proper status code,headers, and messages
	private NettyHttpErrorAdapter nhea;
	...
	public NettyOutbound createUser(HttpServerRequest req, HttpServerResponse resp){
		return req.receive()
					 .aggregate()  
                     .asString()  
                     .map(c -> json.toObject(c, UserReqDto.class)) // Mono<Try<UserReqDto>>
                     .flatMap(tryToMonoTry(UserService::create)) // Mono<Try<UserRespDto>>
                     .flatMap(tryToMonoVoid(st -> send(resp,201,st), // happy path
						                    t -> sendError(resp,nhea.adapt(t))); // sad path
	}
}
```

With that you would propagate all errors that might happen to the last layer (a REST API in the previous case) other case would be to send an event or a message to a message bus, would almost be same way.

* If you keep all code that most possibly throws exceptions handled through `Try.of()` any exception would be handled and wouldn't blow in the application.
* In case anything blows, Reactor has error() signal in its Mono and Flux, and Reactor Netty would deal with those as Internal error and convert them into a `500` .
