I ask myself this question repeatedly and carefully, take my time with it. Sometimes I look back and see a journey 
* At the start of one's life in programming it seemed like a very tough question (and it is) as we don't know our options
* Soon as we know "some of them" we hastily return types according to a pattern, or little logical thinking
* Sometimes when lucky we depend on those whom are more experienced, and their written APIs
* If not we continue in the mess, realising our mistakes after we go through tests(if we do TDD) and implementation
* With some maturity mistakes are less and the fine line between a checked exception and an option, either or a try is **very thin**.
