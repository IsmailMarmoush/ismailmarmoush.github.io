My Technical interests:

* Java
* Software Architecture
* Software Engineering
* Linux
* Security
* Devops
* Frontend as a hobby
* I admire C and Go lang
* I know some Scala, I like many concepts it has,
but I don't like its complexities and the idiomatic mathematical pretentious culture around it.

Want to know more, or connect ?
