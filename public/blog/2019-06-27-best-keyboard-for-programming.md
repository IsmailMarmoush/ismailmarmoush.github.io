## TL;DR

This is the best keyboard design `ANSI 75%`:

Most keyboards are either too compact, or oversized

## The Very compact

**The 60% / 70% Compact Keyboards**

Common on modern laptops—often Apple-inspired—these "hipster" layouts with tiny arrow keys are a productivity nightmare.

You constantly need to press the Fn key just to navigate. Highlighting with `Home`/`End`? Good luck. And let’s not even talk about hitting the down arrow instead of up. Whoever designed it cared more about look than functionality.

## The oversized

Don't get me wrong the very first keyboard I used was 100%, the thing is numpads are mostly useless unless you're doing a lot of numbers data entry and as soon as I started programming the wrist movement was too much, especially switching to/from the mouse.

## So, Why 65% or 75% QWERTY ANSI Keyboards Are the Best

> Update: As someone rightly pointed out—75% is optimal if you want the function key row. But this post celebrates the **5% column** + compactness.

* **Compactness**: Everything is within easy reach. No wrist travel.
* **The 5% Column**: `Delete`, `Home`, `Page Up/Down`, and `End` are logically stacked and easy to use.
* `End` is right above the → arrow — perfect placement.
* `Delete` is just above `Home` and diagonal from `Backspace` — intuitive flow.
* The **Enter** key is neat and minimal. No oversized ISO monstrosities.

## My all-time favorite layout?

I was lucky that the first laptop I had was **Dell Inspiron 1545**, btw after almost 15 years, it's still working.
